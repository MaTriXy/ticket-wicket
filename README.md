ticket-wicket
=============

A event creation and ticket sales app built on the Ethereum blockchain. Built at [ETHWaterloo](https://ethwaterloo.com/) hackathon.

## Development

1. Install global dependencies:

  `npm install -g truffle`

  `npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc`

2. Run `testrpc` locally

3. Compile the contracts `truffle compile`

4. Start the app

  `cd client && yarn install`

  `cd client && yarn start`

## Notes

The client app creates the event contract so we don't actually need to use `truffle migrate` but you can if you want
